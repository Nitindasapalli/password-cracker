# Password Strength & Hash Cracker

A beginner-friendly project demonstrating:
- Password strength estimation (entropy-based)
- Wordlist-based hash cracking for learning and safe testing

**Usage examples**
- Estimate strength:
  `python password_strength.py "Correct Horse Battery Staple"`

- Crack a hash:
  `python hash_cracker.py --hash <hash> --alg md5 --wordlist wordlists/small_wordlist.txt`

**Warning:** Only test on hashes and accounts you own or have permission to test.
